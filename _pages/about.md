I'm a 👨‍💻 Data Scientist at the Pyrenean Institute of Ecology (IPE-CSIC), where I specialize in 🧠 Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods applied to 🌍 climate science. My research focuses on using 🤖 large language models (LLMs) to analyze and extract structured information from unstructured textual data, particularly news articles that report on extreme weather events and their societal impacts.

I have a background in 💻 computer engineering and systems engineering, along with professional experience in 🔐 DevSecOps and ☁️ cloud environments. I am currently pursuing a 🎓 Master's in Artificial Intelligence Research with a specialization in 📊 Data Science.

Outside of research, I like to stay active by 🏃‍♂️ exercising regularly, playing ♟️ chess, exploring new technologies, and spending time outdoors 🌳 with friends, especially when it leads to good conversations.

## Recent Updates

- 🧑‍🏫 **Workshop** _(July 23, 2025)_: I presented a workshop on _Structured Information Extraction using Large Language Models_ to my colleagues at the Pyrenean Institute of Ecology. The workshop covered technical details of using LLMs for extracting structured data from unstructured text. You can find the workshop materials in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/javiervela/llm-information-extraction-workshop).
- 🎓 **PhD Announcement** _(July 15, 2025)_: Starting Fall 2025, I will begin a PhD in Computer Science at Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI) with Prof. Tian Guo. I will work on an NSF-funded project in ⚛️ quantum cloud computing, focusing on algorithms and resource management tools to make quantum computing more accessible.

- 📝 **Conference Paper** _(February 6, 2025)_: _Distributed Simulation with Efficient Fault Tolerance_ was published online as part of GECON 2024. The paper proposes a replication-based approach to fault tolerance in distributed simulation, achieving minimal overhead in cloud environments. You can read it [here](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-81226-2_23), and it is also listed in the [Publications](https://javiervelatambo.com/publications/) section of this website.
