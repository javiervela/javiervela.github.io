I'm a PhD Student in 💻 Computer Science at Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI), where I research ⚛️ Distributed Quantum Computing and Quantum Cloud technologies.

I have a background in Computer Science and Engineering, blending industry experience in DevSecOps and ☁️ cloud environments with academic research in 🧠 NLP and LLMs. At the 🏔️ Pyrenean Institute of Ecology (IPE-CSIC), I applied these methods to extract structured information from 🌍 climate-related news. I have completed a Master's in Artificial Intelligence Research with a specialization in 📊 Data Science.

Outside of research, I like to stay active by 🏃‍♂️ exercising regularly, playing ♟️ chess, exploring new technologies, and spending time 🌳 outdoors with friends, especially when it leads to good conversations.
