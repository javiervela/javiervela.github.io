tldr: Master Thesis for Research in Artificial Intelligence at the Universidad Internacional Men√©ndez Pelayo (UIMP). This thesis presents CienaLLM, a novel approach for extracting structured climate-impact information from unstructured news articles using autoregressive large language models (LLMs). The study evaluates the effectiveness of LLMs in identifying and classifying climate-related events, demonstrating their potential to enhance climate impact analysis and support decision-making processes.
